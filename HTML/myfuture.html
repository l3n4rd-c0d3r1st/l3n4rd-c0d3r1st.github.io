    <h2>Future Career</h2>
    <p><blockquote><a href="../MEDIA/IMAGES/FOR MYFUTURE/softwareengineer.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../MEDIA/IMAGES/FOR MYFUTURE/softwareengineer.jpg" alt="Software Engineer" class="placeleft"/></a>My future career is to be a Software Engineer. Software engineers design and create computer systems and applications to solve real-world problems. They know how to use the right programming languages, platforms, and architectures to develop everything from computer games to network control systems. In addition to building their own systems, software engineers also test, improve, and maintain software built by other engineers. Choosing a career as a software engineer gives you opportunities to work in many different industries and fields, as nearly all businesses use software. Whether you enjoy finances, entertainment, sports, real estate, or some other industry, there's a good chance there are jobs for software engineers. It's also a career that allows flexibility in where you work. You may be able to work from home for companies in other states or even other countries. The important thing is that you're able to meet deadlines and deliver a project on time. Although I have many things to learn to pursue this career, I will do my best to study and put a lots of my effort in my work.</blockquote></p>

    <h2>Future Car</h2>
    <p><blockquote><a href="../MEDIA/IMAGES/FOR MYFUTURE/fordmustang.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../MEDIA/IMAGES/FOR MYFUTURE/fordmustang.jpg" alt="Ford Mustang Shelby GT500" class="placeleft"/></a>My dream car when I was knowledgeable about cars is the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Its monstrous 760-hp supercharged V-8 launches the coupe with eye-watering force, and its immense grip causes sensations of euphoria or nausea or both. All the while its thrilling exhaust note provides the soundtrack, and a rapid-shifting automatic transmission handles gearchanges for the rear-drive-only coupe. The Shelby GT500 isn't just the mightiest Mustang ever, it's also the most powerful road car Ford has ever built. Opting for the Carbon Fiber Track Pack optimizes the GT500's performance, but it also costs almost a quarter of the Shelby's base price. These are some of its features why I choose to own this kind of car. The price is quite expensive but I am sure that it is worth it to own.</blockquote></p>

    <h2>Future Travel</h2>
    <p><blockquote><a href="../MEDIA/IMAGES/FOR MYFUTURE/touristspot.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../MEDIA/IMAGES/FOR MYFUTURE/touristspot.jpg" alt="Tourist Spot" class="placeleft"/></a>When I get rich and retire from my work, I want to experience travelling on different countries. The countries that I want to visit are Japan, Australia, England, Greece, and United States of America. I am fascinated about their places and inspired by my friends who already travelled to different countries. This will also be fun and experience new things because you put yourself in a place that has different culture, language, place, and people. I remember that my professor always told as to enjoy life and travel to other countries to relax. We only live ones so why not enjoy the things we can experience here in Earth while we are still alive. Visit "My Future Travels" page to know which specific places I want to travel.</blockquote></p>
