        <p><blockquote class="indent">Much of the period between the first Roman invasion in 55 BC and the death of Henry VIII in 1547 was spent in warfare - Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions were followed by the Norman Conquest in 1066. The Hundred Years' War dominated the 14th and 15th centuries and, scarely had it ended, aristocratic rivalries for the throne led to the Wars of the Roses.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote>The Elizabethan Age heralded a period of great change and international expansion, but was followed by civil war in the 17th century. By the end of the 19th century, the industrial revolution and the establishment of a parliamentary system and the growth of an Empire had transformed the country. During the latter half of the 20th century, following the ravages of two world wars and the end of its imperial adventure, England was forced to redefine its relationship with the rest of Europe.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Tower of London</h2>
        <p><blockquote class="indent"><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/ENGLAND/Tower of London.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/ENGLAND/Tower of London.jpg" alt="Tower of London" class="placeleft"/></a>Prison, palace, treasure vault, observatory, and menagerie: the Tower of London has done it all and it's one of the top attractions in London. Widely considered the most important building in England, there's enough to see and do at this World Heritage Site to keep visitors busy for hours.</blockquote></p>
        <p><blockquote>The centerpiece of this Thames-side fortress is the White Tower. Built in 1078 by William the Conqueror, it's home to amazing exhibits, such as Line of Kings, the world's oldest visitor attraction, established in 1652 with a remarkable display of royal armor.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Stonehenge</h2>
        <p><blockquote class="indent"><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/ENGLAND/Stonehenge.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/ENGLAND/Stonehenge.jpg" alt="Stonehenge" class="placeright"/></a>Stonehenge, 10 miles north of the historic city of Salisbury on Salisbury Plain, is Europe's best-known prehistoric monument. It's so popular that visitors need to purchase a timed ticket in advance to guarantee entry.</blockquote></p>
        <p><blockquote>Exhibitions at the excellent Stonehenge visitor center set the stage for a visit, explaining through audio-visual experiences and more than 250 ancient objects how the megaliths were erected between 3000 and 1500 BC, and sharing information about life during this time.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote class="indent"><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/ENGLAND/Lake District National Park.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/ENGLAND/Lake District National Park.jpg" alt="Lake District National park" class="placeleft"></a>Covering some 900 square miles, Lake District National Park is a must-visit destination for travelers to England. With 12 of the country's largest lakes and more than 2,000 miles of rights of way waiting to be explored, there's little wonder the region continues to inspire, with its magnificent views and scenery straight out of a painting.</blockquote></p>
        <p><blockquote>Other things to do include visiting the park's many fells, including Scafell Pike, the highest mountain in England. Be sure to also spend time exploring some of the lovely little towns and villages dotted throughout the region, such as Grasmere. Better still, hop aboard a tour boat excursion across Lake Windermere and Ullswater, and you'll be rewarded with some of the best scenery anywhere in the country.</blockquote></p>

        <h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
        <p><blockquote class="indent">England's contribution to both British and world culture is too vast for anything but a cursory survey here. Historically, England was a very homogeneous country and developed coherent traditions, but, especially as the British Empire expanded and the country absorbed peoples from throughout the globe, English culture has been accented with diverse contributions from Afro-Caribbeans, Asians, Muslims, and other immigrant groups. Other parts of the United Kingdom have experienced the same social and cultural diversification, with the result that England is not always distinguishable from Wales and Scotland or even Northern Ireland. The former insularity of English life has been replaced by a cosmopolitan familiarity with all things exotic: fish and chips have given way to Indian, Chinese, and Italian cuisine, guitar-based rock blends with South Asian rap and Afro-Caribbean salsa, and the English language itself abounds in neologisms drawn from nearly every one of the world's tongues.</blockquote></p>
