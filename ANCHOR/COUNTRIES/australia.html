        <p><blockquote class="indent">Humans are thought to have arrived in Australia about 30,000 years ago. The original inhabitants, who have descendants to this day, are known as aborigines. In the eighteenth century, the aboriginal population was about 300,000. The aborigines, who have been described alternately as nomadic hunter-gatherers and fire-stick farmers (known for using fire to clear the brush and attract grass-eating animals instead of cultivating the land), settled primarily in the well-watered coastal areas. Some observers believe that poor treatment of the environment by aborigines over many centuries may have led to the barren nature of much of the Australian interior. Higher forms of mammals never reached Australia because the land bridge from Asia ceased to exist about 50 million years ago.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Sydney Opera House</h2>
        <p><blockquote><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/AUSTRALIA/Sydney Opera House.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/AUSTRALIA/Sydney Opera House.jpg" alt="Sydney Opera House" class="placeleft"/></a>Shaped like huge shells or billowing sails, this famous building on Sydney's Bennelong Point graces the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is one of the world's great architectural icons.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote class="indent">The location is stunning. Water surrounds the structure on three sides, and the Royal Botanic Gardens border it to the south. Danish architect, Jørn Utzon won an international competition for its design but withdrew from the project after technical and financing problems. Construction was finally completed in 1973 at a cost 10 times the original budget. By this time, Utzon had left the country, never returning to see his magnificent creation.</blockquote></p> 
        
        <p><blockquote class="indent">Today, you can enjoy a performance here, dine at one of the restaurants, or see the highlights of the Sydney Opera House on a guided tour. The structure encompasses theaters, studios, a concert hall, exhibition rooms, and a cinema.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Bondi Beach</h2>
        <p><blockquote><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/AUSTRALIA/Bondi Beach.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/AUSTRALIA/Bondi Beach.jpg" alt="Bondi Beach" class="placeright"/></a>Bronzed bodies, blond sand, backpackers, and surf - throw it all together and you get one of the world's most famous beaches. Only 15 minutes by car from Sydney's city center, Bondi Beach is a great spot for a taste of Sydney's beach culture. Bask on the golden sands, surf the breaks, or take a cool dip on a hot summer's day. Bondi also has a wild side. Crowds of tourists and locals gather here to celebrate Christmas, and ring in the New Year. It's a favorite spot for travelers.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote class="indent">Away from the shore, you'll find plenty of things to do in Bondi. Take a stroll along the Bondi to Bronte coastal walk. It begins at the southern end of the beach and follows the coastline for six scenic kilometers along sandstone cliffs. And if you work up an appetite, you'll find plenty of cafés and restaurants nearby. You can also hunt for bargains at the Sunday markets or swim some laps in the ocean pool.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Daintree National Park</h2>
        <p><blockquote><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/AUSTRALIA/Daintree National Park.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/AUSTRALIA/Daintree National Park.jpg" alt="Daintree National Park" class="placeleft"/></a>A Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, Daintree National Park in Far North Queensland is among the most ancient ecosystems on Earth. The area belongs to the Eastern Kuku Yalanji Aboriginal people, and many of its natural features hold great spiritual significance.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote class="indent">The park encompasses two main sections: Mossman Gorge, where crystal-clear waters gush over granite boulders, and Cape Tribulation, one of the most beautiful places to visit in Australia. Here, rainforest meets reef along the white sandy beaches of the Coral Sea. This stunning stretch of coast is one of the few places in the world where two of the planet's richest ecosystems converge.</blockquote></p>
            
        <p><blockquote class="indent">The park's astounding biodiversity includes more than 18,000 plant species and a vast array of animal species, including the cassowary, crocodile, giant blue Ulysses butterfly, and the secretive Bennett's tree kangaroo.

        <h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
        <p><blockquote class="indent">Australian friendships run deep and are especially loyal. It is common for people to rely upon their friends or 'mates' in hard times more than family. Migrants and foreigners are often surprised by how openly and quickly Australians begin to establish the basis for this mateship. Moreover, relationships tend to be built on camaraderie rather than hierarchy. In this way, people tend to show respect to friends and peers through gestures of equality instead of deference. Considerable effort is put into being fair to everyone in social interactions. For example, it is considered bad taste to ask someone to do anything you would not do yourself. People who hold themselves in higher esteem than their mates are quickly reminded of their place. Furthermore, Australians tend to strongly dislike it when friends knowingly put them in awkward situations that oblige them to do something without having necessarily wanted or offered to.</blockquote></p>
