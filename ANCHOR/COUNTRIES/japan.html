        <p><blockquote class="indent">Japan was settled about 35,000 years ago by Paleolithic people from the Asian mainland. At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a culture called the Jomon developed. Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels. According to DNA analysis, the Ainu people may be descendants of the Jomon.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote>Buddhism came to Japan during the Asuka period, 538-710, as did the Chinese writing system. At this time, society was divided into clans. The first strong central government developed during the Nara period. The aristocratic class practiced Buddhism and Chinese calligraphy, while agricultural villagers followed Shintoism.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote>Samurai lords, called "shogun," took over the government in 1185, and ruled Japan in the name of the emperor until 1868. The Kamakura Shogunate ruled much of Japan from Kyoto. Aided by two miraculous typhoons, the Kamakura repelled attacks by Mongol armadas in 1274 and 1281. A particularly strong emperor, Go-Daigo, tried to overthrow the shogunate in 1331, resulting in a civil war between competing northern and southern courts that finally ended in 1392. During this time, a class of strong regional lords called "daimyo" increased in power; their rule lasted through the end of the Edo period, also known as the Tokugawa Shogunate, in 1868.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Imperial Tokyo</h2>
        <p><blockquote><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/JAPAN/Imperial Tokyo.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/JAPAN/Imperial Tokyo.jpg" alt="Imperial Tokyo" class="placeleft"/></a>Tokyo's most famous landmark, the Imperial Palace with its beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats, is a must-see when visiting the nation's capital. Don't be put off by the fact that the majority of the palace is closed to the public, as there is still enough to see simply by strolling the grounds.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote>In addition to the many fine views of the palace from numerous points in the surrounding parkland, visitors are permitted into the East Higashi-Gyoen Garden and other areas that are opened to the public as part of an organized tour. One of the most romantic views is of the famous Nijubashi Bridge, or "double bridge," so named for its watery reflection.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Mountain Fuji</h2>
        <p><blockquote><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/JAPAN/Mountain Fuji.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/JAPAN/Mountain Fuji.jpg" alt="Mountain Fuji" class="placeright"/></a>Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark, majestic Mount Fuji is also the country's highest mountain peak. Towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise largely flat landscape to the south and east, this majestic and fabled mountain is tall enough to be seen from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers away.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote>Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and literature and is now considered so important an icon that UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013. Part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount Fuji is climbed by more than a million people each summer as an act of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the sunrise from its summit.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park</h2>
        <p><blockquote><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/JAPAN/Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/JAPAN/Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.jpg" alt="Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park" class="placeleft"/></a>While little needs to be said here of the horrors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945, much can be said of the incredible efforts this vibrant city has made to commemorate the many victims of the world's first nuclear attack. Perhaps even more importantly, Hiroshima has become a symbol of lasting peace.</blockquote></p>
        
        <p><blockquote>Visited by more than a million people each year, many from overseas, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park (Hiroshima Heiwa Kinen K≈çen) lies at the epicenter of the atomic blast in what was once a bustling part of the city. Here you'll find a number of important monuments, memorials, and museums relating to the events of that fateful day.</blockquote></p>
            
        <p><blockquote>In addition to the grounds and gardens with their colorful cherry blossoms, the park is where you'll find the Peace Memorial Museum, with its numerous exhibits dealing with the issue of world peace. It's also where you'll find the Memorial Cenotaph and the Flame of Peace, as well as the Atom Bomb Dome, the ruins of an administrative building that lay at the center of the explosion.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote class="indent">Japanese culture is ancient and is filled with rites and traditions to honor the family. Because Japan is an island country, it was able to moderate the influence of other cultures for centuries. This allowed a distinct culture and heritage to develop for the beautiful Land of the Rising Sun. With important rites of passage, festivals of celebration, and unique dress and style, details from the lives of your Japanese ancestors will brighten your family stories.</blockquote></p>
        <p><blockquote>Two major religions influence Japanese traditions and culture: Shintoism and Buddhism. Shintoism has been practiced in Japan for over 2,000 years. Simply said, Shintoism is the belief in kami (gods). Because Shintoism has a lot to do with rituals, some Japanese may not feel it is a religion at all, but rather a way to celebrate many of Japan's social traditions. For this reason, Buddhism can be practiced right alongside Shinto customs.</blockquote></p>
