Recreations of the New York skyline, the Eiffel Tower, the canals of Venice, and many more foreign sites line this famous street.</blockquote></p>
        <p><blockquote>One of the main attractions in Las Vegas is the constant lineup of shows. World-famous singers looking to settle down turn to Las Vegas as a home base, where they perform regularly. Unique performing groups from magic to comedy and acrobatics can also be found here nightly.</blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote><a href="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/USA/Niagara Falls.jpg" target="newWindow"><img src="../../MEDIA/IMAGES/TOURISTSPOT/USA/Niagara Falls.jpg" alt="Niagara Falls" class="placeright"/></a>Situated along the Canada-US border, Niagara Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in the world. The water from Lake Erie flows into Lake Ontario over these massive waterfalls, known for the great quantity of water that is constantly tumbling over the vertical drop.</blockquote></p>

Carved out by the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon cuts deep into the landscape, creating dramatic cliff walls and ledges. Visitors standing on the rim of the canyon can see down to the canyon floor a mile below, and look out over the ridges and cliffs that run as far as the eye can see.</blockquote></p>
        <p><blockquote>The South Rim, about 4.5 hours by car from Las Vegas, is the most visited section of Grand Canyon National Park. This is where you'll find a large visitor center, regular bus service along the Rim in the high season, and a walkway that runs along the canyon with numerous viewing points and platforms</blockquote></p>
